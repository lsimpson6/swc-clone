                    Based on individual needs, often further lab testing helps to identify nutrient deficiencies, absorption of nutrients, thyroid status, and any other red flags the body is trying to tell you. Functional lab testing goes one step beyond standard lab testing to assess hormone status, adrenal function, the gut microbiome and more. Common functional tests used are the GI MAP, DUTCH Sex Hormone Testing, DUTCH Adrenal Panel (Cortisol testing) and the Organic Acids Test (OAT).
                    <br />*While functional lab testing can be insightful, it is the most beneficial after establishing and meeting our basic needs.
