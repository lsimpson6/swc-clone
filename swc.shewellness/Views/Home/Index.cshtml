            <p>I’m a mama, wife, Registered Nurse and Candidate for a Board-Certified Nutrition Specialist. Through my own health struggles, I have discovered the awe-inspiring power of food and the impact true nourishment can have on your symptoms and diagnosis. Now, I have set out on a mission to empower other women to do the same, be informed of their health and truly feel well. The rumors are false: you can have your health and eat your cookies too.</p>
